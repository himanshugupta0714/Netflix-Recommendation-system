# Netflix-Recommendation-sysytem

##
Problem - How NETFLIX can make us binge watch by giving us the best recommedation??

Approach-
Content Based Recommendation system using NLP , Cosine Similarity
Recommendation system in which recommended movies have similiar content with already liked movies. But first,we need to define content .Content can be a story,or script. I am going to take a brief summary of the movie, cast and genres the content of the movie , and recommend movies with similiar content.
Now,
I will merge all of them in one text . But computers cannot understand the meaning of these texts,thus we need to apply some pre-processing operations to our "content". I used NLP (Natural Language Processing)

# WHAT IS NLP?
---NLP is an area of machine learning focused on teaching computers to understand natural human language better.
---NLP enables computer programs to understand unstructured data, to make inferences and provide context to language, just a human brain does. 
---Applications - Text analysis, Email Filtering ,POS tagging

# What is Cosine similiarity?
--Cosine Similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. This similarity measurement is particularly concerned with orientation, rather than magnitude. In short, two cosine vectors that are aligned in the same orientation will have a similarity measurement of 1, whereas two vectors aligned perpendicularly will have a similarity of 0. If two vectors are diametrically opposed, meaning they are oriented in exactly opposite directions (i.e. back-to-back), then the similarity measurement is -1. Often, however, Cosine Similarity is used in positive space, between the bounds 0 and 1. Cosine Similarity is not concerned, and does not measure, differences is magnitude (length), and is only a representation of similarities in orientation.
